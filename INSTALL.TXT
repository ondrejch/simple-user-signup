Simple site registration script bundle
======================================'

* Overview 

There are 3 scripts which work together: 
register.pl - displays registration form, register accounts for creation and sends out email
confirm.pl  - if the user clicks on the emailed link, calls the next script
ua.pl       - actually creates the account


* Installation instructions:

1) Change strings in all scripts to match your local needs.
2) Move all scripts to /usr/lib/cgi-bin directory, chown www-data & chmod 700 all of them
3) mkdir /var/cache/register/; chmod www-data: /var/cache/register/
4) Add the folowing line to /etc/sudoers to make it work:
www-data ALL=NOPASSWD:/usr/lib/cgi-bin/ua.pl
